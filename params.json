H@    is  also  used  for  the  Framework  for  JAS.\r\n\r\nH@  uses   HIBER.TEMPLATE  to  perform  operations  like Insertion,Select  all,Having  clause,Update  ,delete  ,Select  \r\n\r\nan  follows  One-One ,  One- many  ,Many  to Many  mapping   in   JAS-Hibernate(H@).\r\n\r\nJAS -H@ is  invented by  wilmix   jemin  j   at  oct   2015.\r\n\r\nH@  is   easy  to  establish  connection   with  WDBAJAS.  H@   is  used  in  cloud  computing..\r\n\r\nH@  is  one  of   the  best   ORM  tools  of  all  Technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTAX  of  H@:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<?H@\r\n\r\n@HRemote  //  It  is  used  to load  H@ packages\r\n\r\n<JAS-WDBA> //  It  is    used   to  load   JAS  -WDBA  packages\r\n\r\nand  to make  connection  with  WDbaJAS  database.\r\n\r\n<%\r\n\r\n<!
