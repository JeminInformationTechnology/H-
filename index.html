<p>@HRemote  //  It  is  used  to load  H@ packages</p>

<p> //  It  is    used   to  load   JAS  -WDBA  packages</p>

<p>and  to make  connection  with  WDbaJAS  database.</p>

<p>It  also   has   JAS  advantages.</p>

<p>Using  H@  which  makes   cloud  web application  very   fast.</p>

<p>we can view   all  the  details   about  WDBAJAS  in  H@  itself.
since   it  has direct  connection  with  wdbaJAS.
-&gt;  it  also   pocess  attractive  syntax.
-&gt; It  is   learnable.</p>

<p>-&gt; It also behave  like  WDBAJAS database.
 -&gt; It  has   beautiful  outputs  and  beautiful  templates
